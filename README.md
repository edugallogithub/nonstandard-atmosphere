# nonstandard-atmosphere
Atmosphere model intended for aircraft trajectory prediction.  Provides atmospheric properties based on geopotential altitude based on temperature and pressure offsets. Coincides with ICAO Standard Atmosphere (ISA) when both offsets are zero.
Model described in arXiv:2101.10744v1 [eess.SY] at https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10744
